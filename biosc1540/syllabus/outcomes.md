# Outcomes

There are only two required courses in the [Bachelor's degree in computational biology](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/computational-biology) where learning computational biology is the focus.
After this course, students must take computational genomics (BIOSC 1542) or simulation and modeling (BIOSC 1544).
Students taking this course should gain insight into which class they prefer.
People in academia and industry typically only work in one of these subfields, it is paramount for professionals to have a base understanding of both.
Outcomes for this course are thus geared towards giving students a practical introduction to both subfields.

Furthermore, since this is one of the only courses exposing computational biology majors, this course is designed with them at the forefront.
This course is accessible to those from a biology-focused background; however, additional effort is likely needed on the front end to stay relevant with computational techniques and an open-ended problem-solving format.

Course outcomes are crucial in higher education, providing a clear roadmap for instructors and students.
They define the knowledge and skills students are expected to gain, guide the course structure, and inform assessments.
This course is designed with the following outcomes in mind:

1.  Acquire practical data analysis, modeling, and interpretation skills with Python.
2.  Understand and apply genomic and transcriptomic analysis techniques.
3.  Explore the principles and techniques of structure-based drug design.
4.  Learn and apply ligand-based drug design concepts.
5.  Enhance problem-solving and critical thinking skills in the context of computational biology.

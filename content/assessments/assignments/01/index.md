## Problem 1

**Points**: 6

Why is the quality of sequencing data typically lower at the end of a read in Sanger sequencing?

## Problem 2

**Points**: 6

What is the purpose of adding adapters to DNA fragments in Illumina sequencing?

## Problem 3

**Points**: 4

Compare and contrast the principles behind Sanger sequencing and Illumina sequencing.
How does each method overcome the challenge of determining the order of nucleotides in a DNA strand?
In your answer, consider the strengths and limitations of each approach.

## Problem 4

**Points**: 5

In Sanger sequencing, the ratio of dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) to deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) is crucial for successful sequencing.
Explain why this ratio is essential and predict what might happen if:

1.  The concentration of ddNTPs is too high;
2.  The concentration of ddNTPs is too low.

## Problem 5

**Points**: 4

Illumina sequencing uses "bridge amplification" to create clusters of identical DNA fragments.
Describe how this process works and explain why it's necessary for the Illumina sequencing method.
How does this compare to the amplification process in Sanger sequencing?

## Problem 6

**Points**: 4

You are designing primers for a Sanger sequencing experiment.
The region you want to sequence contains an important single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 90 from the start of your sequence of interest.
Given what you know about the typical quality of Sanger sequencing reads at different positions, where would you design your sequencing primer to bind?
Explain your reasoning.

## Problem 7

**Points**: 2

You are conducting a Sanger sequencing experiment on a gene of interest isolated from a wild plant population.
Upon examining the chromatogram, you notice that multiple peaks frequently overlap at several positions, making base calling difficult.
This pattern persists even when you repeat the sequencing with newly designed primers.
Further investigation reveals that the plant samples were collected from an area known for its high biodiversity and the presence of closely related species.

What is one possible molecular or genomic explanation for the overlapping peaks observed in your chromatogram?
Describe how it could lead to the pattern in the sequencing results.

## Problem 8

**Points**: 4

In Illumina sequencing, adapters are ligated to DNA fragments before sequencing.

-   Explain the role of these adapters in the sequencing process.
-   How might errors in adapter ligation affect the sequencing results and downstream data analysis?
-   Describe how the design of these adapters helps prevent the formation of adapter dimers.

## Problem 9

**Points**: 5

Compare the structure of a typical surfactant to a phospholipid.
How do these structural differences contribute to the surfactant's ability to lyse cells?
Explain why increasing the concentration of surfactants in a lysis buffer might not always lead to better DNA yield.
What potential problems could arise from using too much surfactant?

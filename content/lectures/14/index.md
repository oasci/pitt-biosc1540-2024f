Building on the foundations from the previous lecture, this session focuses on the practical aspects of setting up and running MD simulations. We'll walk through the steps involved in preparing a system for simulation, from initial structure to production run.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Outline the steps involved in setting up an MD simulation.
2.  Explain the importance of system preparation, including solvation and ion placement.
3.  Describe the process of energy minimization and its importance.
4.  Discuss the concept of equilibration and its role in MD simulations.
5.  Explain periodic boundary conditions and their importance in MD simulations.
6.  Identify key parameters and their significance in running production MD simulations.

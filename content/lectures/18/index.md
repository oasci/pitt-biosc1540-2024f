This lecture focuses on ligand-based drug design, an approach that leverages information from known active compounds to discover new drug candidates. We'll explore various ligand-based methods, including quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), pharmacophore modeling, and similarity searching. The session will highlight how these techniques complement structure-based approaches and their application in lead optimization and scaffold hopping.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Define ligand-based drug design and its role in drug discovery pipelines.
2.  Explain the principles of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and their applications.
3.  Describe ligand-based pharmacophore modeling and how it differs from structure-based approaches.
4.  Discuss the concept of molecular similarity and its use in compound library screening.
5.  Outline the process of scaffold hopping in lead optimization.
6.  Compare and contrast ligand-based and structure-based drug design approaches, identifying scenarios where each is most appropriate.

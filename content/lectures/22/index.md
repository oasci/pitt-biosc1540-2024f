# Lecture 22

**Date:** Nov 14, 2024

This lecture introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of systems biology, which aims to understand complex biological systems through a holistic approach. We'll explore how systems biology integrates various biological data types and computational methods to model and analyze cellular networks and organism-level processes. The session will cover key concepts such as network biology, metabolic modeling, and multi-scale integration. By examining real-world applications, students will gain insight into how systems biology is revolutionizing our understanding of biological complexity and its implications for medicine and biotechnology.

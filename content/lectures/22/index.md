For today's lecture, we will have an open work session dedicated to your ongoing projects.
This is a great opportunity to focus on your work, collaborate with classmates, and address any challenges you might be facing.
Additionally, I will be available to provide help with PyMol, a powerful molecular visualization tool that can enhance your project presentations and analyses.

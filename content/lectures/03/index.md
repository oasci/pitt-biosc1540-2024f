This lecture delves into the crucial process of genome assembly, a cornerstone of modern genomics research. We'll explore the concept of reference genomes and their pivotal role in decoding genetic information. The session introduces essential file formats used in bioinformatics and tackles the complex challenge of reconstructing complete genomes from fragmented sequencing data. By comparing de novo and reference-guided assembly methods, students will gain insight into different approaches for genome reconstruction. We'll walk through the key steps and concepts of reference-guided assembly, providing a comprehensive understanding of how scattered genetic pieces are woven into a coherent genomic tapestry. This foundational knowledge will empower students to navigate the intricate landscape of genome assembly and its applications in biological research.

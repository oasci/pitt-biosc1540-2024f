This session focuses on the critical steps of quality control and preprocessing in genomic data analysis.
We will explore the fundamentals of sequencing data formats and delve into essential techniques for assessing and improving data quality.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Explain the basic concepts and importance of genome assembly.
2.  Interpret FASTA and FASTQ file formats and their role in storing sequences.
3.  Perform and interpret quality control on reads using FastQC.
4.  Identify common quality issues in sequencing data and explain their impacts.
5.  Describe the process and importance of sequence trimming and filtering.

<!-- NOTE:

-   This was too much material to cover in one lecture.
-   N50 and L50 were confusing concepts
-   Probably spend too much time on why we use ASCII or error source. I could streamline this.
-   Perhaps I can have students be responsible for that material for more activity time.

This lecture covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of gene annotation, a critical process in genomics for identifying and characterizing genes within DNA sequences.
We'll explore various computational and experimental methods used in gene annotation, their applications, and challenges.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

1.  Define gene annotation and explain its importance in genomics and molecular biology.
2.  Describe the main steps involved in the gene annotation process.
3.  Explain key algorithms and tools used in computational gene prediction.
4.  Identify challenges in gene annotation and strategies to address them.
5.  Interpret basic gene annotation data and outputs.

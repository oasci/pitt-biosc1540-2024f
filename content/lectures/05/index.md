This lecture covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of gene annotation, a critical process in genomics for identifying and characterizing genes within DNA sequences.
We'll explore various computational methods used in gene annotation, their applications, and challenges.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

1.  Explain the graph traversal and contig extraction process in genome assemblers.
2.  Understand key output files and quality metrics of genome assembly results.
3.  Define gene annotation and describe its key components.
4.  Outline the main computational methods used in gene prediction and annotation.
5.  Analyze and interpret basic gene annotation data and outputs.

We'll explore the challenges of aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome and discuss various algorithms and data structures that make this process efficient.
The session will focus on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and the FM-index, two key concepts that revolutionized read alignment by enabling fast, memory-efficient sequence searching.
We'll examine how these techniques are implemented in popular alignment tools and compare their performance characteristics.

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Describe the challenges of aligning short reads to a large reference genome.
2.  Compare read alignment algorithms, including hash-based and suffix tree-based approaches.
3.  Explain the basic principles of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) for sequence alignment.

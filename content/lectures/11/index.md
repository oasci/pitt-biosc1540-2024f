This lecture introduces the field of computational structural biology and its interplay with experimental methods.
We'll explore how computational approaches complement and enhance traditional structural biology techniques, providing insights into protein structure, function, and dynamics.
The session will cover key experimental methods like X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryo-EM, highlighting their strengths and limitations.
We'll then delve into how computational methods address these limitations and extend our understanding of molecular structures.
This foundational knowledge will set the stage for deeper exploration of computational techniques in structural biology.

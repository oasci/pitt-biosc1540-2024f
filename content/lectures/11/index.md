This lecture introduces the field of computational structural biology and its interplay with experimental methods.
We'll explore how computational approaches complement and enhance traditional structural biology techniques, providing insights into protein structure, function, and dynamics.
The session will cover key experimental methods like X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

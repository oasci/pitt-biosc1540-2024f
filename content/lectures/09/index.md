We'll explore how raw sequencing reads are transformed into meaningful measures of gene activity, navigating the complexities of multi-mapped reads and isoform variations.
The session will compare various quantification metrics, from traditional RPKM to more recent innovations like TPM, highlighting their strengths and limitations.
We'll examine cutting-edge tools for transcript-level quantification and discuss the crucial role of normalization in generating comparable expression data across samples.
Through practical examples, students will learn to interpret gene expression results, bridging the gap between computational output and biological insight.

## Late assignments and extensions

I am mindful of the diverse nature of deadlines, particularly in the scientific realm.
Some are set in stone, while others exhibit more flexibility.
It is noteworthy that the scientific community frequently submits manuscripts and reviews days, weeks, or months after the editor's request.
Such practices are widely understood.
Conversely, submitting a grant application even a minute past the deadline makes it ineligible for review.

I will use the following late assignment and extension policy.
It encourages timely submissions while acknowledging the influence of external commitments and unforeseen circumstances.

-   Each assignment has a specified due date and time.
-   Assignments submitted after the due date will incur a late penalty.
-   The late penalty is calculated using the function: % Penalty = 0.01 (1.4 $\times$ hours late)<sup>2</sup> rounded to the nearest tenth.
    This results in approximately:

    | Hours late | Penalty |
    | ---------- | ------- |
    | 6 | 0.7% |
    | 12 | 2.8% |
    | 24 | 11.3% |
    | 48 | 45.2% |
    | 72 | 100.0% |

-   Assignments will not be accepted more than 72 hours (3 days) after the due date.
-   The penalty is applied to the assignment's total possible points.
    For example, if an assignment is worth 100 points and is submitted 36 hours late, the penalty would be approximately 13 points.
-   To reward punctuality, each assignment submitted on time will earn a 2% bonus on that assignment's score.
-   These on-time bonuses will accumulate throughout the semester and will be added to your final course grade.

Exceptions to this policy will be made on a case-by-case basis for extenuating circumstances.
Please communicate with me as early as possible if you anticipate difficulties meeting a deadline.

By submitting assignments on time, you can earn up to 2% extra credit on your final grade, depending on the number and weight of assignments in the course.
This bonus can potentially bump your grade to the next highest letter grade if you are close.
Consequently, I will not round up any final grades.

## Quiz drop policy

Throughout the semester, there will be several quizzes designed to assess your understanding of the course material and provide you with regular feedback on your progress.
However, we recognize that students may face unexpected challenges or have an occasional off day.
To accommodate such circumstances and to alleviate some of the stress associated with quizzes, the course includes a quiz drop policy.

Under this policy, each student will be allowed to drop their lowest quiz score from their final grade calculation.
This means that if you miss a quiz due to an unforeseen situation or if you have a particularly low score on one of the quizzes, that quiz will be automatically dropped from your overall quiz grade, and your remaining quiz scores will be used to calculate your final quiz average.

Please note that this policy is intended to provide flexibility and support for students, but it should not be used as a substitute for consistent preparation and engagement with the course material.
Students are still expected to attend classes regularly, complete all assigned readings and problem sets, and make a genuine effort to perform well on all quizzes.

If you have any questions about the quiz drop policy or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out to the instructor or the teaching assistants.
We are here to support your learning and help you succeed in this course.
